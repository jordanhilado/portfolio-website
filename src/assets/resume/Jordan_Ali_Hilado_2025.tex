\section*{EXPERIENCE}

\noindent
\textbf{Microsoft} \hfill San Francisco, CA \\
\textit{Software Engineer} \hfill Jun 2024 - Present
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scaled globally distributed ingestion systems for Azure Resource Graph (ARG) to handle 7B+ resource events daily by driving Event Hub scale-outs and VMSS autoscaling across 41 service clusters in 5 regions each, doubling throughput and reducing production outages by 40\%
    \item Enhanced ingestion reliability by shipping newline-delimited JSON processing, improved blob deserialization, and deterministic fallback logic for dynamic payloads in C\#/.NET microservices on Service Fabric, enabling ARG to handle rapidly growing customer scope and evolving compliance requirements
    \item Strengthened data durability and isolation by implementing EU data boundary migration for over 20 enterprise tenants and 300+ Azure Event Grid endpoints, ensuring data sovereignty and compliance while ensuring zero downtime
    \item Streamlined incident response time by automating infrastructure denylisting using Kusto/KQL and Azure Monitor, cutting mitigation times from minutes to seconds for government, F500, and internal customers
\end{itemize}
