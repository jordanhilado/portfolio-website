\section*{EXPERIENCE}

\noindent
\textbf{Microsoft} \hfill San Francisco, CA \\
\textit{Software Engineer} \hfill Jun 2024 - Present
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scaled distributed ingestion systems for Azure Resource Graph to handle 10B+ resource events daily, by driving Event Hub scale-outs and VMSS-based autoscaling across 41 service clusters in 5 global regions, resulting in 2x higher throughput and a 40\% reduction in production outages.
    \item Enhanced ingestion reliability by shipping newline-delimited JSON processing, improved blob deserialization resiliency, and deterministic fallback logic in C\#/.NET microservices on Service Fabric, enabling ARG to handle growing customer scope and evolving compliance requirements.
    \item Supported EU data boundary isolation for over 20 enterprise and government tenants by migrating 300+ global Event Grids to EU-isolated endpoints via fault-tolerant, idempotent deployment pipelines, ensuring data sovereignty and compliance while maintaining uptime.
    \item Improved incident response time by automating infrastructure denylisting using Kusto/KQL and Azure Monitor, cutting mitigation for government and F500 customers and streamlining on-call operations across ARG's global fleet.
    \item Led CPU profiling analysis and optimization efforts to reduce unexpected high CPU usage in critical microservices, improving overall system stability and customer satisfaction.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Walt Disney Animation Studios} \hfill Burbank, CA \\
\textit{Software Engineer Intern} \hfill May 2023 - Aug 2023
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed and re-engineered a legacy Linux-native application into a React and FastAPI web platform integrating the Autodesk ShotGrid REST API, enabling 100+ production managers to dynamically manage animated shot metadata for feature films with improved accessibility, scalability, and maintainability.
    \item Enhanced data integration and integrity across the studio's production pipeline by developing automation workflows using Python, Postman, AWS, Snowflake, Apache Airflow, and REST APIs improving overall data reliability.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textit{Software Engineer Intern} \hfill May 2022 - Aug 2022
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed, tested, and implemented 12+ fixes and features for internal production and employee management tools using React, Django, GraphQL, and Cypress while improving type efficiency through a JavaScript-to-TypeScript transition and delivering user-requested enhancements via Agile and CI/CD collaboration with product design teams.
    \item Automated employee profile metadata synchronization using Apache Airflow, MySQL, Python, REST APIs, and Ruby on Rails, increasing cross-system sync volume and reliability within the employee records system
